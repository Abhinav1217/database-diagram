= Introduction =

I wanted a simple tool that I could dump my database structure into and it would show me a diagram.

When I change the database, I could have a visual history of the changes.

==Warning: MySQL only==

Currently database-diagram only works with MySQL 5 dumps - structure only. MyISAM and InnoDB.
