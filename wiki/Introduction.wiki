= Introduction =

I wanted a simple tool that I could dump my database structure into and it would show me a diagram.

When I change the database, I could have a visual history of the changes.

== Warning: MySQL 5.0+ only ==

Currently database-diagram only works with MySQL 5 dumps - structure only. MyISAM and InnoDB.

This is only because I don't have access to any other flavour of SQL. Feel free to post your SQL into the bug tracker :)

== Warning: Browser with canvas only ==

Works in Firefox 3.5, Opera 9.64 and Chrome 2

== Warning: Save diagram is Firefox 3.5 only ==

Database-diagram uses the localStorage which is Firefox 3.5 only. This saves the x, y locations of the tables.
